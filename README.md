# Java_Quadrilaterals
Inheritance Hierarchy class
Write an inheritance hierarchy for classes ​Quadrilateral​, ​Trapezoid​,Parallelogram​, ​Rectangle and ​Square​. Use ​Quadrilateral
as the superclass of the hierarchy. Create and use a ​Point class to represent the points in each shape. Make the hierarchy as deep 
(i.e., as many levels) as possible. Specify the instance variables and methods for each class. The private instance variables of
Quadrilateral should be the x-y coordinate pairs for the four endpoints of the Quadrilateral​. Write a program that instantiates objects 
of your classes and outputs each object’s area (note: your code should not allow ​Quadrilateral ​to be instantiated). 
NOTE: for simplicity, assume the shape is positioned in such a way that the two parallel sides are parallel to the x-axis, or the y-axis 
(you decide which axis to use).
